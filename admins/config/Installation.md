1. Stop your server.
2. Place the WildRegeneration.jar file in your plugins folder.
3. Download and install preferably [FAWE](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/13932) or [WorldEdit](https://enginehub.org/worldedit#downloads). FAWE should be preferred as its performance is much better.
4. Start your server.
5. Edit the configuration (`worlds.yml` and `config.yml`) to your liking. You can find explanations in the comments located in your config file. The config can be found in the plugin's folder (`/plugins/WildRegeneration`).
6. Restart your server

WildRegeneration doesn't have any commands or permissions yet. Everything can be configured in the config.
Please always stop your server before installing updates. The config and locale files automatically remove new entries and remove no longer existing entries.
