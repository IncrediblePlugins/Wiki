Here you can find information about WildRegeneration for server administrators.

# Disclaimer
WildRegeneration does regenerate chunks back to its original state. No snapshots are taken. This only works with the default Minecraft world generation. FastAsyncWorldEdit or WorldEdit needs to be installed. It's recommended to take regular backups of your world in case you want to revert a regeneration, or you accidentally misconfigure something.
