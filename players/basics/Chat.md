Chatting with your land and nation members may be crucial.

# Land Chat
The easiest way to chat with land members is by just sending a message in the normal chat with the following format: ``@land <message>``
Just make sure to replace ``<message>`` with the message of your choice.

If you want to send a message to a specific land, just add the land name before the message: ``@land <land> <message>``

Examples:
* ``@land Hello my fellow land members!`` -> Sends a message to your current edit land.
* ``@land Test Hello my fellow land members of land Test!`` -> Sends a message to the land named ``Test``.

## Alternative Command
If you want to send messages using a command, just execute ``/lands chat [land] <message>``. The ``[land]`` parameter is optional and the behaviour is the same as with the chat tag above.

# Nation Chat
The easiest way to chat with nation members is by just sending a message in the normal chat with the following format: ``@nation <message>``
Just make sure to replace ``<message>`` with the message of your choice.

If you want to send a message to a specific nation, just add the nation name before the message: ``@nation <nation> <message>``

Examples:
* ``@nation Hello my fellow nation members!`` -> Sends a message to the nation of your current edit land.
* ``@nation Test Hello my fellow nation members of nation Test!`` -> Sends a message to the nation named ``Test``.

## Alternative Command
If you want to send messages using a command, just execute ``/nations chat [nation] <message>``. The ``[nation]`` parameter is optional and the behaviour is the same as with the chat tag above.
