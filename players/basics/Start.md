# Claiming
## General
Just executing ``/lands claim`` will claim an initial area for you. If you want to
choose a name for your land, you need to execute ``/lands create <name>`` before that.

## Selection
The selection mode allows you to claim large areas with ease. Just execute ``/lands selection``, select both corners by just clicking, and
execute ``/lands claim``.

# Management
You can manage your land in the menu by executing ``/lands`` or by using the commands. To see a list of available commands,
just execute ``/lands help``.

## Multiple Lands
If you're part of multiple lands, you can decide for which land commands are executed, by executing the ``/lands edit <land>`` command once.
Allow following commands will be executed for this land. Editing lands in the GUI menu doesn't require this.

# Trust Players
Command: `/lands trust <player> [area]`\
If you don't specify an area for the `[area]` parameter, the player will be trusted in the whole land.
Alternatively, open your land menu (`/lands`), navigate to the players menu and click on the `Trust Player` button.

# Untrust Players
Command: `/lands untrust <player> [area]`\
Alternatively, open your land menu (`/lands`), navigate to the players menu and click on the `Untrust Player` button.
